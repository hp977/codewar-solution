// Question
// Create a function that returns the name of the winner in a fight between two fighters.

// Each fighter takes turns attacking the other and whoever kills the other first is victorious. Death is defined as having health <= 0.

// Each fighter will be a Fighter object/instance. See the Fighter class below in your chosen language.

// Both health and damagePerAttack (damage_per_attack for python) will be integers larger than 0. You can mutate the Fighter objects.

// Your function also receives a third argument, a string, with the name of the fighter that attacks first.
// My answer
function declareWinner(fighter1, fighter2, firstAttacker) {
    const f1 = Math.ceil(fighter1.health / fighter2.damagePerAttack)
    const f2 = Math.ceil(fighter2.health / fighter1.damagePerAttack)
    return f1 < f2 ? fighter2.name : f2 < f1 ? fighter1.name : firstAttacker
  }

// Other answer
function declareWinner(fighter1, fighter2, firstAttacker) {
  if (fighter1.name !== firstAttacker) return declareWinner(fighter2, fighter1, fighter2.name)
  if (fighter1.health <= 0) return fighter2.name
  if (fighter2.health <= 0) return fighter1.name

  return declareWinner(new Fighter(fighter2.name, fighter2.health - fighter1.damagePerAttack, fighter2.damagePerAttack), fighter1, fighter2.name)
}
